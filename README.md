### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Project Description
I will use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

The code will generate an interactive experience in the terminal to present interesting descriptive statistics from the data of your choice.

### Files used
Files used in this project were provided by Motivate as three separate csv files:
chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv and washington.csv.

### Credits
